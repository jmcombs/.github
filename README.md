# Hi there\! 👋

I'm Jeremy Combs, a Cisco Collaboration enthusiast and open source developer based in Atlanta, GA. I create and maintain tools and themes that solve real-world problems for developers and users with accessibility needs.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### [sftp](https://github.com/jmcombs/sftp)
A multi-architecture Docker image for SFTP that makes secure file sharing simple and accessible. Born from a real need in my workflow, this project helps teams securely share files across different platforms and architectures.

### [blue-psl-10k](https://github.com/jmcombs/blue-psl-10k)
An eye-friendly theme designed specifically for people with astigmatism. This unified theme works across VS Code, Ghostty, Oh-My-Posh, and macOS Terminal, featuring carefully crafted pastel colors that reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## 💡 Why Sponsor Me?

I build tools that I need, and I share them because I believe others might need them too. My focus is on:

- **Accessibility**: Creating themes and tools that work for everyone, especially those with visual challenges
- **Practical Solutions**: Building utilities that solve real problems in development workflows
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Ensuring my projects work across different architectures and platforms
- **Community First**: Maintaining open source projects that benefit the broader developer community

## 💰 How Sponsorship Helps

Your sponsorship directly supports:

- ⚙️ **Hosting & Build Costs**: Multi-architecture builds and container hosting aren't free
- ⏰ **Development Time**: More time to maintain, improve, and expand these projects
- 🌟 **Supporting Dependencies**: Contributing back to the open source projects I rely on
- 🆕 **New Features**: Building the features and improvements the community requests

## 🎯 Current Goals

- Maintain and improve multi-architecture support for sftp
- Expand blue-psl-10k theme support to additional editors and terminals
- Create more accessibility-focused development tools
- Contribute back to the open source ecosystem that makes my work possible

## 🙏 Thank You\!

Every sponsorship, no matter the size, means the world to me. It's not just about the financial support—it's validation that what I'm building matters to others. Thank you for considering supporting my work\!
