# Hi there\! 👋

I'm Jeremy Combs, a Cisco Collaboration enthusiast and open source developer based in Atlanta, GA. I create and maintain tools and themes that solve real-world problems for developers and users with astigmatism.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

### [sftp](https://github.com/jmcombs/sftp)
A multi-architecture Docker image for SFTP that makes secure file sharing simple and accessible. Born from a real need in my workflow, this project helps teams securely share files across different platforms and architectures.

### [blue-psl-10k](https://github.com/jmcombs/blue-psl-10k)
An eye-friendly theme designed specifically for people with astigmatism. This unified theme works across VS Code, Ghostty, Oh-My-Posh, and macOS Terminal, featuring carefully crafted pastel colors that reduce eye strain during long coding sessions.

## 💡 Why Sponsor Me?

I build tools that I need and share them with the community. My focus areas:

- **Accessibility**: Creating themes and tools that work for everyone, especially those with visual challenges like my own
- **Practical Solutions**: Building utilities that solve real problems in development workflows
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Ensuring projects work across different architectures and platforms
- **Community First**: Maintaining open source projects that benefit the broader developer community

## 💰 How Sponsorship Helps

Sponsorship supports:

- **Hosting & Build Costs**: Multi-architecture builds and container hosting
- **Development Time**: Maintenance, improvements, and feature development
- **Supporting Dependencies**: Contributing to the open source projects these tools rely on

## 🎯 Current Goals

- Maintain and improve sftp
- Expand blue-psl-10k theme support
- Contribute back to the open source ecosystem
